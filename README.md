# Human Resource Analytics: Emory RAS (Research Administration Services) - Employee Performance Evaluation, Awards & Promotion

The two datasets (provided in both .sav and .xlsx formats) record the complete career histories of RAS staff at Emory University. (Note that the .sav files are updated versions through data processing.) The "ratings" dataset includes all the annual performance evaluation results of the staff; the "promotion_merit" dataset contains all the information about the number of merit awards received by each employee and the occurrence and time to his/her first promotion.

In this project, statistical analyses have been conducted in different aspects -- whether descriptive analysis using graphs and testings or statistical modeling. A variety of statistical and analytical/visual techniques are applied, such as frequency tables, cross-tabs, Chi-square analysis, independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, histograms, boxplots, Ordinal Regression and Poisson Regression, as well as survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier survival function plots, log-rank statistics, Cox Regression etc.). SPSS is the main statistical software utilized here.

(As for the report, please see all the pictures of analysis results in the Appendix attached to the end.)
